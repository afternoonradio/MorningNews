    <h2>Announcing the Death of Xanthe ███ Miller </h2>  <!--First-level title, usually the main title of the web page(1 largest, 6 smallest)-->
    <p>By the President of the United States of America</p>
    <h4>A Proclamation</h4>
    <p class="left">To the People of the United States:</p>

    <p class="left">It is my sad duty to announce officially the death of Xanthe ███ Miller, the 49th President of the United States.
     She has been taken from us by an attack that shocked and angered the entire nation yesterday, June 3, 2036.</p>

    <p class="left">God chose her — a leader of wisdom and strength — to guide our nation through her vision and ideals.
     She was, to our Nation what the sun is to the Earth: her light reached and warmed every soul who belong to this land.
     As she once said, “This is the best age, the age of the people.” With a heart that ever burned with devotion to her citizens, 
     she served a world that belongs to all, and labored to make it ever more free and orderly.</p>

    <p class="left">Now, Therefore, I, ███ █ ███, President of the United States of America, in honor and tribute to the memory of Xanthe ███ Miller, 
     and as an expression of public sorrow, do appoint hereby June 5, the day of the funeral service of President Miller, 
     to be a National Day of Mourning throughout the United States. 
     I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us on this day of mourning and rededication.</p>
    
    <p class="left">In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.</p>
     
    <p class="left">DONE at the City of Washington this fourth day of June in the year of our Lord two thousand and thirty-six, 
     and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixty.</p>

    <p class="left">███ █ ███</p>
