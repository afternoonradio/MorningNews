    <p>Yesterday, a 35-year-old woman crashed her aircraft into the Miller statue located at the center of Caesar Square.
       According to reports, she is a test pilot employed by ██ Airlines. During a test flight, a solar storm disrupted multiple parts of the flight control system, 
       causing her to unintentionally deviate from the planned route and resulting in the accident.
       The woman remains in a coma and is currently receiving treatment at ███ Hospital. 
       Colleagues who have worked with her for many years stated that the incident was purely accidental and had no political motives or connection to any act of terrorism.
